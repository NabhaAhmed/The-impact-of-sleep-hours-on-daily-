# ☕ How Coffee Affects Sleep — and How Sleep Affects Energy  

### 📊 Project Overview  
This data story explores the relationship between **coffee consumption, sleep duration, and energy levels**.  
The key insight: **More coffee = less sleep = less energy**  

The visualization shows how our daily habits — like how much coffee we drink — can directly impact our sleep quality and overall energy.

### 🧠 Concept  
While many people rely on coffee to boost energy, the data suggests that **lack of proper sleep** reduces energy even more than coffee can restore.  
The project opens up a discussion on whether coffee truly helps, or if **better sleep quality** is the real source of sustained energy.
